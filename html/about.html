            My name is Dennis Humm. I'm a father to two beautiful girls and
            husband to one kick-ass roller derby wife. I'm in my mid-to-late
            30's and am an avid collector of fountain pens. Before that,
            however, I practiced the art of calligraphy mainly to help with my
            awful handwriting.

            See what I mean? Nice ink though (KWZ EI Dorado if you were
            curious).

            I handwrite drafts for my novel and found calligraphy was helping to
            make my work actually legible and soon enough my wife, Annika,
            bought her own. Naturally I had to try it and found she had even
            better taste than me so I made an executive decision to buy another
            pen. And then another one and another one until I finished my first
            complete draft, whereupon, I decided that I had earnt another pen. I
            bought myself a Lamy 2000 as my reward.

            In my epic search for different pens and filling methods, I came
            across some custom fountain pen websites (Scriptorium Pens, Newton
            Pens and Edison Pens - definitely check them out) and was inspired
            to buy yet another pen. A <strong>custom</strong> one. But alas,
            after many hours of fruitless searching, I found nothing within my
            price-range. Exhausted and utterly degected, I mornfully looked over
            a fountain pen subreddit and discovered that there was lots of
            advice on making pens. I had access to an engineering lathe and
            figured I would give it a go - completely kitless.
