          very much. I particularly liked the shape of the grip. If I need
          another pen I won't hesitate to contact you. Have a nice afternoon and
          evening. Stay safe. Regards, CL."

          "Hi Dennis, just to let you know my pen arrived & I am over the moon
          with the quality. You were right, the photo on your website does not
          do this material justice. You have a true talent. Needless to say I
          will be back once I have saved more money. Thanks, Edward."

          Saturday. It looks amazing, writes wonderfully and is very comfortable
          to use."

          "A custom, handmade fountain pen... What can I say? I absolutely love
          it!! The quality of the body is great - it sits perfectly together
          with the threaded lid, and the cap posts perfectly without any wobble
          or slip. The nib is broad and it's lovely and smooth to write with.
          Den was brilliant... He wanted to make sure that I was 100% happy and
          sent through an amazing selection of material to choose from and
          design options with regards to the cap and the clip. Got to say, the
          pictures do not do the material justice - it's got a beautiful shimmer
          under the light which is just about caught on the images but in
          person, it's even better.
          <br />
          The theme I wanted to go with was space and the material is perfectly
          representing that. Couldn't be happier! Thank you Den!"

          <br />
          "The pink heart pen I got from Den's Pens is beautiful to look at and
          a delight to write with. It was a smooth, consistent writer out of the
          box. The entire time Dennis was making this pen, he sent me updates
          with pictures and asked if there was anything I would like to change.
          He was wonderful to work with and actually made me feel like I was
          there watching over his shoulder as he created my pen. He was very
          concerned that I would be happy with the finished product, which I
          certainly was. This is the first custom-made pen I've ever had and I'm
          sure I'll be coming back to have him make me another in the future."
